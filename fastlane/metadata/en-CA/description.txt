Team Turnly turns everyday chores into a shared game your whole household can enjoy.

Instead of reminders and nagging, Team Turnly helps you organize tasks in a fun, visual way. Create a team, choose playful avatars, and assign daily or weekly chores to each member. Everyone clearly sees what needs to be done, whose turn it is, and what’s coming next — no confusion, no stress.

Tasks are easy to create and customize, whether it’s cleaning, studying, or small routines you want to build together. Progress is tracked automatically, so completed tasks feel rewarding and motivating. Kids stay engaged thanks to friendly characters and simple interactions, while adults appreciate the structure and clarity.

You can manage teams, adjust notifications, and fine-tune task lists to fit your household’s rhythm. Team Turnly works equally well for families, roommates, or small groups who want to stay organized without turning chores into a chore themselves.

If you’re looking for a lighter, more positive way to share responsibilities and build better habits together, Team Turnly makes teamwork feel natural — and even a little fun.
